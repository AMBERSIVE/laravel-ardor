# Basics

You can get a full overview of the ardor blockchain endpoint documentation [here](https://testardor.jelurida.com/test).

## What is ardor?

If you are not familiar with ardor here is a short summary:
Ardor is a blockchain technology. The main difference between bitcoin/litecoint etc. and the ardor blockchain is the fact that ardor does not use the "proof of work" approach. Which means there a not super difficult calculations to be made to proceed a transaction and add it to the chain.

Ardor is also special because it offers child chains (like IGNIS was the first childchain for ardor).
Also a unique feature is the rich RESTful API it provides. This API is the foundation for this project.

Ardor is based on JAVA. That means for web applications like laravel based PHP-Apps it is quite good that you have this rich endpoint infrastructure.

## What's the goal of this project

Well in previous years the maintainer of this project worked on many ardor based blockchain projects and was forced to reimplement the ardor blockchai into this project every time. That was time consuming and a bit of annoying. This package should resolve this basic implementation + it offers syntax sugar and convientient functions (like php side blockchain contracts or the bundling part)
