# Use the bundled class

There are many classes in this package.
While this is good during development and performance this might be "boring" if you do not wand to declare everything.

Therefore we provide a bundle class for all classes

```php

use AMBERSIVE\Ardor\Classes\Ardor;

$ardor = new Ardor();
```
